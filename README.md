# Project--1-Make-a-Movie-Trailer-website
First udacity project - making a movie trailer website
Files included:
    media.py
    entertainment_center.py
    fresh_tomatoes.py
    Read_Me_Movie_website.txt

media.py - constructs the Class structure

entertainment_center.py - creates all the instances of Class Movie and stores
all of the information presented on the site.

fresh_tomatoes.py - creates the web interface that is used.


The run process must originate in entertainment_center.py and all three of the
above files need to be in the same directory.

The movies listed are:
    The Replacements
    Sherlock Holmes (the first one)
    School of Rock
    The Proposal
    Couples Therapy
    American Sniper

When starting this up the program makes a file fresh_tomatoes.html which is
actually the web interface which comes to the screen.
